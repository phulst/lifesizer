This repository contains the source code previously owned by LifeSizer, Inc.

This (Ruby on Rails) application used to power LifeSizer.com, which was
shut down as of 12/31/2018 along with the dissolution of LifeSizer, Inc.

Its code has been released into the public domain using the Unlicense (http://unlicense.org)

Passwords, API keys and other sensitive information have been removed, as

DISCLAIMER:

While you may use this source code in any way you see fit, this project was
not developed as an open source project. Configuration isn't very well
centralized and there are many references to lifesizer.com host names throughout
the code. The code may use deprecated APIs to communicate with 3rd party services,
and is lacking documentation.

Most of this code was written in 2011-2012, and this project uses frameworks
and other libraries that may be over 8 years old.
